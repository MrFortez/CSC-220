Complexity: How badly does an algorithm react to an increasing amount of data? (not runtime)

Constant Family: Algorithms that has constant runtime regardless of the datasize.
    Represented by O(1)   (O means order)

Linear Family: Algorithms that rise linearly proportional to the data size. 
    Represented by O(n) (this is not math, the big O does not deal with constants; 
        Every linear algorithm will be represented by O(n))

Quadratic Family: Algorithms that rise quadratically proportional to the data size.
    represented by O(n^2)
