Shell sort essentially sorts only portions of the list at a time.
You do several sets of passes of either bubble sort or insertion sort.
In the first pass, you have some variable k, and you basically just sort 
every index divisble by k as if it were its own list. Then you do every element
divisible by k + 1, then k + 2... until you reach k + (k-1).
At this point, you subtract k by some amount (up to the user) and do the same 
thing again.
Keep doing these sets of passes until you reach k = 1, at which point you can do
insertion sort. The purpose of this algorithm is to place items in their approximately 
correct posistions to take advantage of insertion sorts high optimization capabilities,

for example, if you have a list of 10 items and your first k = 3, Then you sort
items 0, 3, 6, 9; then 1, 4, 7; then 2, 5, 8; 
Then you reduce k by 1, which would make it 2. Then you sort 
items 0, 2, 4, 6, 8; then 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Finally, reduce k by 1 to reach k = 1 and just do insertion sort to finish it off.

k can be set to any arbitrary value and can be reduced by some arbitrary value every cycle.

20, 5, 3, 7, 12, 1, 8, 19  k = 3
7, 5, 3, 8, 12, 1, 20, 19  
7, 5, 3, 8, 12, 1, 20, 19
7, 5, 1, 8, 12, 3, 20, 19  

k - 1 == 2
now k = 2
1, 5, 7, 8, 12, 3, 20, 19
1, 3, 7, 5, 12, 8, 20, 19

k - 1 == 1
now k = 1, so just do a regular sort.
1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 19, 20
