Quick Sort is based on the premise of pivot values.
Basically, you chose some number to be your pivot, then look at
 the rest of the numbers in the list. If a number is smaller
 than the pivot value, it goes to the left of your pivot, otherwise
 it goes on the right. Once this pass is done, this pivot number will
 by definition be sorted and will never have to be moved again, and each
 side of your pivot becomes a new list. Then chose a new pivot in each of
 the new lists and repeat.

Assuming you choose the first number in the list to be your pivot, you first
 find the first number starting from the left of the list that is bigger than
 your pivot and mark it with "L", and find the first number starting from the
 right of the list that is smaller than your pivot, mark it with "R". Swap the numbers
 in L and R. Next, continue right from L until you find another value bigger than the pivot,
 and continue left from R until your find another value smaller than the pivot. Swap them.
 keep doing this until L and R meet. Once they meet, swap the pivot with the number in
 the position 1 before this meeting point. The pivot is now sorted, and will 
 never need to be moved again. You now have 2 seperate lists, one on either side 
 of the pivot. Now, you can perform this algorithm in each of those 2 lists. You can
 repeat this sub dividing any number of times.
