When deleting nodes from a tree, the action depends on where the node is.
If its a leaf, just remove the link from the parent.
if it is a parent with one child, the parent becomes the child.
it it has two children, you go down the right branch once, then go left as
    many times as you can. The node you reach once you cant go left anymore
    will replace the deleted node
